## COVID-19 IN Germany

The repository is used to track the covid-19 outbreak in Germany(https://yanxiall.github.io/Covid-19Germany/). It is organized into two separate sections. There is the covid19map which  is a visualization of the data that is collected  with the "scrap" utility. The scrap crawls the data regularly by using github actions. Besides, by using github actions  the project is deployed on the github pages regularly. 

### Features

- A covid-map which shows the infected numbers in every state;
- A table which shows the infected numbers of the cities;
- A curve which shows the change of total daily cases in Germany.
